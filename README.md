# Sample Repo for the Java Web Basics Workshop

This project builds a simple REST API backed by a RDBMS with "old" tech like JDBC
and Servlets. We then move commit by commit to newer tech like JPA and finally
Spring Boot.

The goal of this workshop is to show what a modern stack like Spring Boot builds
upon and that you can build stuff with simple/boring tech, too. Also we encounter
a lot of unexpected complexity (e.g. mapping JOINed tables to objects, parsing HTTP
requests) and talk about libraries/frameworks which help to solve this (e.g. JDBI,
JOOQ, Spark, Ninja) in a minimal way.
